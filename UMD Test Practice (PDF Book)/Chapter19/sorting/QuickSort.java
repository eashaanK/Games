/**
 * Similar to merge sort, it divides the array into two pieces,
 * sorts them individually through recursion, and merges them back together.
 * On average, it has a O(nlog(n)) but can be faster than MergeSort. 
 * One bad thing though: worst case scenario, its runtime can be O(n^2)
 * 
 * To find the pivot where the array is split, move two pointers from
 * left and right until you find the "pivot", just like you would
 * use two fingers to find the center of mass of a stick.
