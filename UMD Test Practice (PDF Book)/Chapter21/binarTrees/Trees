Tree Traversals
1. Inorder Traversals
 - Go Left subtree as long as your own left is not null
 - If it is null, print data
 - Then go Right subtree as long as your own right is not null. DO NOT PRINT AGAIN!
 - Start this process from the root from another method. The algorithm is recursive 
 	- and hence needs a helper method. 
 
2. Preorder Traversal
 - Visit the root
 - Visit the left subtree
 - Visit the right subtree
 
3. Postorder Traversal
 - Visit left subtree
 - Visit right subtree
 - Visit the root

 Solving expressions
 
 One method will take an expression as a String. First, check to make sure that there are an equal
 number of ( and ). Next, the root will be recreated.
